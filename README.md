# Yatri-Mitra
 Yatri Mitra app is to simplify the travel accommodation process while offering flexibility, personalized recommendations, and useful features to enhance the travelerâ€™s experience.

It's a web application developed using Streamlit and Python, designed to assist travelers with accommodation booking and dynamic price checking. 
The app features a chatbot powered by machine learning that can help users find suitable accommodations based on their preferences.

The app integrates real-time dynamic pricing using a Machine Learning model, which adjusts accommodation prices around holidays (2 days before and after) by integrating a Calendar API. It also offers a user review forum where travelers can share their experiences and a recommendation system for personalized accommodation suggestions.
